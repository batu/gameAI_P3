Modified vs Vanilla.

We have implemented 2 different heuristics.
Heruistic #1:
We look at the number of owned boxes for both the player and the opponent.
We simulate the move
If the number of owned boxes increases for the player we reward that move
If the number of owned boxes increases for the opponent we punish that move

Heruistic #2:
We simulate the next move, 
if the move results in a  win state for us we reward that move
if the move results in a win state for the opponent we punish that move.

Player 1 = mcts_modified
Player 2 = mcts_vanilla
rounds = 50

Player  1   2   draw
Wins    5   28  17

Our results show that vanilla is doing better than heuristics implementation.

This show that the heuristics, in its current implementation, is not beneficial. 
We made some assumptions when picking these heuristics to implement, 
but while playing we realized that in certain cases moving to win a box might not be the optimal move. 
We believe forcing our bot to always do this heuristic we are losing out on some potential moves.
It is not surprising that our heuristics were not beneficial because we do not consider ourselves
experts on the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe and are not sure what the optimal strategies are.
