Heruistic #1:
We look at the number of owned boxes for both the player and the opponent.
We simulate the move
If the number of owned boxes increases for the player we reward that move
If the number of owned boxes increases for the opponent we punish that move

Heruistic #2:
We simulate the next move, 
if the move results in a  win state for us we reward that move
if the move results in a win state for the opponent we punish that move.
